## Introduction
Dash is the adorable mascot for Flutter. She's beloved by the community and embodies the fast, friendly, and fun nature of Flutter. Check out her [official page on the Flutter docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/dash) to learn more. 

Stuffed Dash birds are coveted in the community and almost impossible to find. If you have one, hold on to it. They're super rare! 

To address the "Great Dash Shortage" my partner has created a Dash Crochet pattern. Everything below is her work. She generously has agreed to open source the pattern so feel free to use it however you like. :) 

My partner is the ultimate softWEAR developer with a passion for all things fiber related. If you're in eastern Virginia and interested in learning to knit or crochet, check out [Yarn Party](https://www.goyarnparty.com). You're also welcome to reach out to her there if you have questions.

One note... The pattern mentions a bottom pouch. This is for a game I created for Fluttercon Europe 2025. The bottom pouch is to hold a [Bluetooth nRF51822 iBeacon](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832686168978.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2usa). I hid these all over the convention and invited attendees to download the [Flockinator App](https://flockinator.makerinator.com/) to find them. 

If you don't need to hide a BEAKon in your Dash, feel free to skip that part. ;) 

And now for the pattern!

# Crochet Flockinator Bird

**Hook:**  US size G/6 [4mm]
**Yarn:**  Medium Worsted [size 4] weight yarn in Dash colors – light blue, teal blue, light brown, & white
**Notions:**  tapestry needle, scissors, stitch marker, safety eyes [10mm], stuffing, (optional: keychain hardware)

**Gauge:**  Not important, use a hook sized slightly smaller than the yarn calls for to keep the stuffing from showing
**Note:**  This pattern is written using US stitch terminology
